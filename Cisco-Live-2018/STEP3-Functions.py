# This is step 3 of the "Bare Bones" Process - Creating The Empty Functions
# Here is the process I follow for this phase ...
#
#   1 - write out the comments of expected functions
#   2 - create those functions with proper docstrings, logging, and pass ONLY
#   3 - tie the functions together in your __main__
#   4 - test the logic with print or logging statements
