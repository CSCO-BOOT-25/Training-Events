# Why Are We Here?

This set of code is being written for a speech I will be giving (or possibly have given by the time you read this) at an event I was honored to be invited to - Cisco Live 2018 in Cancun, Mexico!

I will be covering a topic I call:  "How To Think Like A Programmer"

While there is no 1 right way to code, I have found that when I don't follow these guidelines I tend to:
- spend way too much time fixing bugs and having to rework code
- be more frustrated
- have to backtrack and add in logging to be able to troubleshoot

The code you will find here will include the process of what I call a bare bones script and will include a program that allows you to:
- play rock, paper, scissors with a computer
- see who won

At some point (and possibly even right now) it will include the ability to store the winnings in a database for best x out of y.
