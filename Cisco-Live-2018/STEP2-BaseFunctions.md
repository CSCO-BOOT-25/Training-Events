# Base Functions

Questions to consider:
- what can be reused later by other programs?
- what might be reused later in by this program?

Base requirement needs:
- a way for user to provide input
- a way for 2nd user (computer) to provide response
- way to calculate winner
- way to print winner

Nice to have needs:
- way to store info (database)
- way to retrieve info (to show scoreboard)
- way to email
- expanded logic for additional options
- possibly Jinja2 for a nice HTML look
